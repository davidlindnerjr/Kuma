Kuma is an application that allows the user to create a pet profile for their dog in order to find the best match for a dog playdate. The User can create one dog profile with their pet's information including name, breed, personality, bio, vet clinic, etc. After a profile is created their profile is shown on the profiles page, including all of the pet's information. By clicking the "dashboard" option on the navbar the user is then able to see the profiles of other user's dogs to see whether or not their pet will be a good match. The application utilizes a Sequelize, node, and express backend using passport for validation; in the front end the HTML is templated with handlebars, uses jQuery for making AJAX calls, and uses Materialize and Bootstrap for CSS frameworks.

This applicatin was a lot of fun, learning, and struggles for this group. We ran into quite the wall in the backend with MySQL and Sequelize, but were eventually able prevail. The part where we exceled the most was in the front end; making calls, styling, and structuring the site. IN the future we plan to add new features like messaging, an interactive calender, and a revamped dashboard feature.

## Heroku Deploy:

## Developer's Remarks:
  
  * Alicia Gorton:
    - This has been my favorite assignment to date. It was challenging at times, but overall it was a great experience. I found a lot of my time used was researching styling techniques and experimenting with design patterns. My biggest challengaes I faced was my computer erroring with multiple database managers and understanding how sessions and cookies transmit user information. I look forward to future work on this application, and imporving on our features we have.
  * Kevin Doh:
    - Though the deadline for this application was tight, I'm very happy with the features that we were able to get working. I've been in the habit of looking at previous code while creating new applications, but for this one I found out a great deal just by getting my hands dirty with Googling and trying new things. It was a difficult project to get off the ground but I'd like to revisit it at some point to improve upon and expand its features.
  * David Lindner: 
    - This project was a lot of fun. I personally had a lot of fun getting to learn and experiment with the CSS framework Materialize. I fell in love with it from the start,       components are so simple looking but really get the job done. Sequelize was the bigest bug I had with this project. I had the hardest ime joining two tables; it took         the team and I several days but we finally got it to work. All in all, it was a great experience and I am excited to see what else can be done with this application in       the future.
